# CordaPoc

Welcome to the CordaPoc. The CordaPoc is based on the [CorDapp tutorial](http://docs.corda.net/tutorial-cordapp.html) found on the Corda docsite.

**This is the KOTLIN version of the CordaPoc.**

**Instead, if you are interested in exploring the Corda codebase itself,
contributing to the core Corda platform or viewing and running sample
demos then clone the [corda repository](https://github.com/corda/corda).**

*Read this in other languages: [PortuguÃªs Brasileiro](README.pt-BR.md)*

## Pre-Requisites

You will need the following installed on your machine before you can start:

* [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) 
  installed and available on your path (Minimum version: 1.8_131).
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (Minimum version 2017.1)
* git
* Optional: [h2 web console](http://www.h2database.com/html/download.html)
  (download the "platform-independent zip")

For more detailed information, see the
[getting set up](https://docs.corda.net/getting-set-up.html) page on the
Corda docsite.

## Getting Set Up

To get started, clone this repository with:

    git clone https://github.com/douglasmorais/cordaPoc.git

And change directories to the newly cloned repo:

    cd cordaPoc

## Building the CorDapp template:

**Unix:** 

    ./gradlew deployNodes

**Windows:**

    gradlew.bat deployNodes

Note: You'll need to re-run this build step after making any changes to
the template for these to take effect on the node.

## Running the Nodes

Once the build finishes, change directories to the folder where the newly
built nodes are located:

    cd build/nodes

The Gradle build script will have created a folder for each node. You'll
see three folders, one for each node and a `runnodes` script.

## Interacting with the nodes

Nodes started via terminal will display an interactive shell:

     Welcome to the Corda interactive shell.
     Useful commands include 'help' to see what is available, and 'bye' to shut down the node.

     Thu Apr 19 09:18:09 BRT 2018>>>

Go to the terminal window displaying the CRaSH shell of PartyA. Typing `help` will display a list of the available commands.

Type `flow list` in the shell to see a list of the flows that your node can run. In our case, this will return the following list:

     com.template.ChangeValueFlow
     com.template.IPOFlow
     com.template.TradeFlow
     net.corda.core.flows.ContractUpgradeFlow$Authorise
     net.corda.core.flows.ContractUpgradeFlow$Deauthorise
     net.corda.core.flows.ContractUpgradeFlow$Initiate
     net.corda.finance.flows.CashConfigDataFlow
     net.corda.finance.flows.CashExitFlow
     net.corda.finance.flows.CashIssueAndPaymentFlow
     net.corda.finance.flows.CashIssueFlow
     net.corda.finance.flows.CashPaymentFlow

Firstly, we want to create an IPO, with shares from company "A". We start the `IPOFlow` by typing:

    start IPOFlow shareValue: 100, owner: "O=PartyA,L=London,C=GB", codigoAcao: "A"

If the flow worked, it should have recorded in the vault of PartyA. Let's check, running:

    run vaultQuery contractStateType: com.template.ShareState

The vault of PartyA should display the following output:

     states:
     - state:
         data:
           shareValue: 100
           owner: "C=GB,L=London,O=PartyA"
           codigoAcao: "A"
           participants:
           - "C=GB,L=London,O=PartyA"
         contract: "com.template.ShareContract"
         notary: "C=GB,L=London,O=Controller,CN=corda.notary.validating"
         encumbrance: null
         constraint:
           attachmentId: "4273B55BA46E3ACF06B1C11865526FC84F51ABF3CE489A2DCCB8149B8187B18F"
       ref:
         txhash: "E4F20D3FC7016B470110DC063001671BF0ECDDDE99C5337A9D31C55CB597072E"
         index: 0
     statesMetadata:
     - ref:
         txhash: "E4F20D3FC7016B470110DC063001671BF0ECDDDE99C5337A9D31C55CB597072E"
         index: 0
       contractStateClassName: "com.template.ShareState"
       recordedTime: 1521834554.082000000
       consumedTime: null
       status: "UNCONSUMED"
       notary: "C=GB,L=London,O=Controller,CN=corda.notary.validating"
       lockId: null
       lockUpdateTime: 1521834554.142000000
     totalStatesAvailable: -1
     stateTypes: "UNCONSUMED"
     otherResults: []

Secondly, we can change the share price, with:

    start ChangeValueFlow shareValue: 80, owner: "O=PartyA,L=London,C=GB", codigoAcao: "A"

Now, the vault of PartyA displays only the last state, with the new price:

     states:
     - state:
         data:
           shareValue: 80
           owner: "C=GB,L=London,O=PartyA"
           codigoAcao: "A"
           participants:
           - "C=GB,L=London,O=PartyA"
         contract: "com.template.ShareContract"
         notary: "C=GB,L=London,O=Controller,CN=corda.notary.validating"
         encumbrance: null
         constraint:
           attachmentId: "A1FED7C10FBB02F9F13EB6EBEB59730CAF1D73DD0AB680BAD1D8338BCA235232"
       ref:
         txhash: "A337543D7D59E7047F86898BF25D60E64A249A985ADF6A0497AA5D944F1A4236"
         index: 0
     statesMetadata:
     - ref:
         txhash: "A337543D7D59E7047F86898BF25D60E64A249A985ADF6A0497AA5D944F1A4236"
         index: 0
       contractStateClassName: "com.template.ShareState"
       recordedTime: 1522091941.076000000
       consumedTime: null
       status: "UNCONSUMED"
       notary: "C=GB,L=London,O=Controller,CN=corda.notary.validating"
       lockId: null
       lockUpdateTime: 1522091941.175000000
     totalStatesAvailable: -1
     stateTypes: "UNCONSUMED"
     otherResults: []

Finally, we can change the owner of the share, typing:

    start TradeFlow shareValue: 90, owner: "O=PartyB,L=New York,C=US", codigoAcao: "A"

The vault of PartyA should display the following output:

     states: []
     statesMetadata: []
     totalStatesAvailable: -1
     stateTypes: "UNCONSUMED"
     otherResults: []

Go to the terminal window displaying the CRaSH shell of PartyB, and check the vault, running:

    run vaultQuery contractStateType: com.template.ShareState

The vault of PartyB should display the following output:

     states:
     - state:
         data:
           shareValue: 90
           owner: "C=US,L=New York,O=PartyB"
           codigoAcao: "A"
           participants:
           - "C=US,L=New York,O=PartyB"
         contract: "com.template.ShareContract"
         notary: "C=GB,L=London,O=Controller,CN=corda.notary.validating"
         encumbrance: null
         constraint:
           attachmentId: "A1FED7C10FBB02F9F13EB6EBEB59730CAF1D73DD0AB680BAD1D8338BCA235232"
       ref:
         txhash: "112557268D7827A6A37FB42A270F9492B93ABAEC8D676C4297407BA0952A3B84"

## Interacting with the CorDapp via HTTP

The CorDapp defines a couple of HTTP API end-points and also serves some
static web content. Initially, these return generic template responses.

The nodes can be found using the following port numbers, defined in 
`build.gradle`, as well as the `node.conf` file for each node found
under `build/nodes/partyX`:

     PartyA: localhost:10007
     PartyB: localhost:10010

As the nodes start up, they should tell you which host and port their
embedded web server is running on. The API endpoints served are:

     /api/template/templateGetEndpoint

And the static web content is served from:

     /web/template

## Running the Nodes Across Multiple Machines

The nodes can also be set up to communicate between separate machines on the 
same subnet.

After deploying the nodes, navigate to the build folder (`build/
nodes`) and move some of the individual node folders to 
separate machines on the same subnet (e.g. using a USB key). It is important 
that no nodes - including the controller node - end up on more than one 
machine. Each computer should also have a copy of `runnodes` and 
`runnodes.bat`.

For example, you may end up with the following layout:

* Machine 1: `controller`, `partya`, `runnodes`, `runnodes.bat`
* Machine 2: `partyb`, `partyc`, `runnodes`, `runnodes.bat`

You must now edit the configuration file for each node, including the 
controller. Open each node's config file (`[nodeName]/node.conf`), and make 
the following changes:

* Change the artemis address to the machine's ip address (e.g. 
  `artemisAddress="10.18.0.166:10005"`)
* Change the network map address to the ip address of the machine where the 
  controller node is running (e.g. `networkMapAddress="10.18.0.166:10002"`) 
  (please note that the controller will not have a network map address)

Each machine should now run its nodes using `runnodes` or `runnodes.bat` 
files. Once they are up and running, the nodes should be able to communicate 
among themselves in the same way as when they were running on the same machine.
